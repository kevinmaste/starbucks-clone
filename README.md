## About this testing copy of a web side

**Firstable:
I didn't realy finish the copy of the web site , i miss some few thing in it. 

**secondable:
I use in for this : material UI for the CSS , Reactjs and material UI icons.

Who can install it , by using yarn or npm it doesn't matter :
`npm install @material-ui/core ` ,`npm install @material-ui/icons` , if you're using `yarn` just put `yarn add` instead of `nom install`.
you can also fork the project and modify it.
